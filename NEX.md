# NEX pre-ICO review [Jan 21st 2018]

Analysis of the NEX whitepaper I feel that NEX has the potential to become a good utility token and a solid earner as profit sharing from a distributed exchange.

It's worth nothing there are quite a few distributed exchanges in the works 0x, NEX, EtherDelta (new owners have big plans), and dozens if not hundreds of smaller ones so there is a lot of competition. Much of their success will come down to building trust and a good community as well as well managed market dynamics (exchanges with unbalanced order books are going to struggle to get traction).

There are quite a few information security considerations for distributed exchanges as it provides a much better macro security position in a lower trust model than traditional exchanges but there are isolated theft risks which will carry some reputation al damage in the short term.

From the white paper, this is the money shot for me at least... 

```
A user owns 1000 NEX, and NEX has generated fees in tokens equivalent to 100 million dollars at market value since they last made a claim. Assuming the user has staked NEX at a rate of 75%, they would be eligible for a claim worth 

$100, 000, 000 ∗ (1000 / 50,000,000) ∗ 0.75 = $1500. 

This rate is hypothetical, and we will release true rates at a later time.
```

EtherDelta, is currently doing about ~$20m/yr in fees (from another review of their smart contract in January), NEX have some scaling woes to achieve the $100M/yr for $1500 return. 

From an ROI perspective, it's far from earth-shattering (2%, relative to say ARK which is at ~10%) but has some solid numbers to support a long life.  

I can't see it being a good lifestyle coin as you would need to hold 1M NEX to get 150k/yr ROI which is a $1M investment at the time of the ICO and substantially more after.

Whitepaper doesn't explain their staking model in great detail, but no mention of delegated proof of stake or masternodes so you'll have to have your wallet hot on a dedicated staking machine.

Will this token pop, yes I can see it being a $10-$40 coin in 2017, perhaps $50 coin if the exchange reaches to Binance or Coinbase volumes. I can't see it becoming a $1000 coin. Looking at Kucoin Shares (KCS) and Binance (BNB) prices/market cap as of 21st of Jan.

## Big Smoke Position

* Buy
* Flip 50% at 10X and HODL!
